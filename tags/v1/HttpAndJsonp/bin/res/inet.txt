You should always keep in mind that a Smart application runs in a browser and as such doesn't have access to files on the local system (unless you are using [PhoneGap](#phonegap) wrappers). All resources that come with the application must therefore either be compiled in or accessed as a file on the server with a *http* request.

This section shows how to execute network requests from a Smart application, either as a plain [*http*](#rtl-networking-http) request or as a [JSONP](#rtl-networking-jsonp) request. Both are implemented in the *w3inet* unit.
